Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
* `views/index.html` is the app's UI
* `public/client.js` (currently blank) is where you can put client-side code
* `views/setup.html` and `public/setup.js` are for the setup helper flow.

On the back-end,
* `server.js` is run when the project starts
* `package.json` contains the app's dependencies
* `translations.json` contains alternate alphabets
* `.env` contains variables custom to the app we don't want other users to see
